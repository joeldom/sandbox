## Sandbox v.1.1

## Concepts

### 1. Generative ColorFlow

prompt
```
use sass to create an animated gradient with values based on complimentary colors with a 3rd color being a neutral gray to near 100% black that uses"colorFlow" as its selector and name of animation in the sass
```
scss
```scss
$color1: #3498db; // Example primary color (blue)
$color2: #e74c3c; // Complementary color (red)
$neutral-color: #333; // Neutral gray to near black

@keyframes colorFlow {
  0% {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, $color1, $color2, $neutral-color);
  }
  50% {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, $color2, $neutral-color, $color1);
  }
  100% {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, $neutral-color, $color1, $color2);
  }
}

.colorFlow {
  animation: colorFlow 5s infinite alternate;
}

```

### 2. EventHandling Ui/Ux

```html
<div class="notification success" id="success-message">
  <span class="icon">&#10004;</span>
  <span class="message">Action completed successfully!</span>
</div>

<div class="notification error" id="error-message">
